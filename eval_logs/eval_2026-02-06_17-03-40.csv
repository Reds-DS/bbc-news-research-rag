What happened in Ukraine?,"The question ""What happened in Ukraine?"" is quite broad and can be interpreted in several ways. However, based on the provided articles, I can provide some general information about events that occurred in Ukraine during the mentioned periods.

In 2022, Russia's invasion of Ukraine began, and there were reports of military attacks, shelling, and rescue efforts to save civilians, such as the one described in the article ""Ukraine: What happened on day 15 of Russia's invasion"" where Ukrainians rescued their grandmothers from Russian shelling.

Additionally, in May 2023, Ukraine was fighting to hold onto the city of Bakhmut, as mentioned in the article ""Ukraine war: Inside the fight for the last streets of Bakhmut"". The situation in Bakhmut was described as a ""crumpled, skeletal wreck"" and losing it could be costly.

It's worth noting that these articles do not provide an exhaustive account of events that occurred in Ukraine, but rather offer glimpses into specific incidents or locations during the mentioned periods.","War in Ukraine: What happened on day 18 of Russia's invasion
