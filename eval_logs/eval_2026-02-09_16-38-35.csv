What is the impact of russian oil on global economy?,"Unfortunately, I couldn't find a specific answer to this question in the provided articles. However, based on the content of the articles, it can be inferred that Russian oil has a significant impact on the global economy, particularly given its heavy dependence on Russian energy.

Article 1 suggests that many countries are heavily dependent on Russian energy and will need to find new suppliers if sanctions are imposed. Article 2 doesn't mention Russia or oil in relation to the UK economy post-Brexit, but it does discuss the challenges of abandoning Russian oil. Article 3 highlights Germany's efforts to reduce its reliance on Russian oil.

Article 4 mentions the windfall tax, which is a measure aimed at addressing the economic impact of high oil prices, but it doesn't directly answer the question about the global economy's dependence on Russian oil.

Therefore, while the articles do touch on the challenges of reducing dependence on Russian energy, they don't provide a specific analysis of its overall impact on the global economy.","Russia sanctions: How can the world cope without its oil and gas?

In April 2022, Russian soldiers pulled out from the town of Bucha, leaving behind a trail of devastation.

Additionally, there were reports of atrocities committed by Russian forces, including the killing of the head of a village near Bucha along with his family.

Who is the actual president of united states?,"According to the provided articles, it appears that there may be some confusion. In one article, Donald Trump was elected as President (Part 2: Election Results), and in another article, he is being profiled as ""The Donald"" (Profile: Who is Donald Trump? (Part 1… The Brand)).

However, none of these articles confirm whether or not Donald Trump has officially taken office as the President of the United States. In fact, a more recent article (More than 40,000 killed in Gaza, Hamas-run health ministry says) mentions an ongoing conflict and war, which may indicate that there is currently no clear winner or president.
