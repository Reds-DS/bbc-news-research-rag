Article 2 doesn't mention Russia or oil in relation to the UK economy post-Brexit, but it does discuss the challenges of abandoning Russian oil. Article 3 highlights Germany's efforts to reduce its reliance on Russian oil.\n\nArticle 4 mentions the windfall tax, which is a measure aimed at addressing the economic impact of high oil prices, but it doesn't directly answer the question about the global economy's dependence on Russian oil.\n\nTherefore, while the articles do touch on the challenges of reducing dependence on Russian energy, they don't provide a specific analysis of its overall impact on the global economy.",
