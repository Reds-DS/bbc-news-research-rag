What is the impact of russian oil on global economy?,"Unfortunately, I couldn't find any information about the specific impact of Russian oil on the global economy in the provided articles. However, we can make some educated guesses based on general knowledge.

The articles do mention that Russia says it may cut off gas supplies if countries decide to ban Russian oil (Article 1), and that Germany is getting rid of Russian oil (Article 3). Additionally, Article 2 discusses the impact of Brexit on the UK economy, but doesn't specifically address the global economy's reliance on Russian oil.

However, we can infer that a reduction in Russian oil exports could have significant economic implications for countries that rely heavily on it. This might include increased energy costs, reduced economic growth, and potential disruptions to global supply chains.

If you're looking for more specific information on the impact of Russian oil on the global economy, I'd recommend searching for additional news articles or economic reports that focus on this topic.","Ukraine war: How reliant is the world on Russia for oil and gas?
